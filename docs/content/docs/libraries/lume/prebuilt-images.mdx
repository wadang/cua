title: Prebuilt Images
---

Pre-built images are available in the registry [ghcr.io/trycua](https://github.com/orgs/trycua/packages). These images come with an SSH server pre-configured and auto-login enabled.

<Callout>
The default password on pre-built images is `lume`. For the security of your VM, change this password after your first login.

## Available Images

The following pre-built images are available to download via `lume pull`:

| Image | Tag | Description | Logical Size |
|-------|------------|-------------|------|
| `macos-sequoia-vanilla` | `latest`, `15.2` | macOS Sequoia 15.2 image | 20GB |
| `macos-sequoia-xcode` | `latest`, `15.2` | macOS Sequoia 15.2 image with Xcode command line tools | 22GB |

| `ubuntu-noble-vanilla` | `latest`, `24.04.1` | [Ubuntu Server for ARM 24.04.1 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/server/arm) with Ubuntu Desktop | 20GB |

## Disk Space

For additional disk space, resize the VM disk after pulling the image using the `lume set <name> --disk-size <size>` command. Note that the actual disk space used by sparse images will be much lower than the logical size listed.

<Callout>
**Important Note (v0.2.0+):** Images are being re-uploaded with sparse file system optimizations enabled, resulting in significantly lower actual disk usage. Older images (without the `-sparse` suffix) are now **deprecated**. The last version of `lume` fully supporting the non-sparse images was `v0.1.x`. Starting from `v0.2.0`, lume will automatically pull images optimized with sparse file system support.
